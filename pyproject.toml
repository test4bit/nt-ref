# --- Basic Setup ---
python_version = "3.12"  # Set your target Python version
mypy_path = "."          # Crucial: Tells mypy to look for modules starting from the root

# --- Strictness and Code Quality ---
strict = true                      # Enable all optional strict checks
warn_unused_ignores = true         # Warn if a '# type: ignore' is no longer needed
warn_redundant_casts = true        # Warn about unnecessary casts
warn_unreachable = true            # Warn about code that can never be executed

# --- Import Handling ---
# This is important for dealing with third-party libraries.
# By default, `strict = true` sets this to false.
ignore_missing_imports = false     # Fail if a library has no type hints (stubs)
